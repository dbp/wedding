            <strong>From Boston</strong> It's about a 3 hour drive from Boston. If you are in the Boston area (or
            are able to easily get there) but don't have a car, let us know at <a href="mailto:travel@amydanielwedding.com">travel@amydanielwedding.com</a>  and
            we'll help coordinate.

            <strong>From New York</strong> The shortest way to get to The Lodge
            is driving - it's about a 6 hour drive. If that sounds too
            long in the car, you can also consider taking a train to Boston and
            then renting/sharing a car from there. We will help coordinate
            shared rides between those who have cars (or can rent them) and
            those that don't. Please write to us at <a href="mailto:travel@amydanielwedding.com">travel@amydanielwedding.com</a> if
            you need help.

            <strong>From Further</strong> You can fly to either Boston, MA or
            Burlington, VT. From Boston, it's a 3 hour drive; from Burlington,
            it's a 1.5 hour drive, but since you'll probably be able to find
            much more direct flights to Boston, that's our recommendation. From
            there, you can easily rent a car and drive up. If you are flying
            and want to coordinate a shared car with others, let us know at <a href="mailto:travel@amydanielwedding.com">travel@amydanielwedding.com</a>
