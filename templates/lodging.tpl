    <h1>Lodging</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>We have booked all the cabins and rooms at Highland Lodge for Friday
        and Saturday nights, so if you want to stay on site, you will not be
        able to book lodging yourself through the Highland Lodge website. If you
        want to stay on site, please indicate your preference for a room in the
        lodge or a cabin on the RSVP form. We will be in touch to give you more
        information about how to book your room or cabin shortly.</p>

        <p><strong>Rates / Rooms</strong>
For the weekend of our wedding, we have negotiated rates from between
$100 to $140 per night for rooms in the lodge (at 2 people per room - slightly higher if
more than two people are in a room). For cabins, the rates are between $120 to $260
per night (depending on which cabin, and how many people are in each cabin -
some can sleep up to 8 people). Unless you are a larger party, staying in a
cabin will likely mean sharing with others (as even the smaller cabins have more
than one room).
