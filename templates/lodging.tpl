    <h1>Lodging</h1>
    <p>We have booked all the cabins and rooms at Highland Lodge for Friday and Saturday nights, so if you want to stay on site, you will not be able to book lodging yourself through the Highland Lodge website. If you want to stay on site, please indicate your preference for a room in the lodge or a cabin on the RSVP form. We will be in touch to give you more information about how to book your room or cabin shortly. Questions? contact@amydanielwedding.com.</p>
