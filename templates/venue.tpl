    <h1>The Highland Lodge</h1>

    <div class="content">
    <p>Highland Lodge sits on one hundred and thirty-six acres on Caspian Lake and Barr Hill in Greensboro, Vermont. Our region of Vermont is called the Northeast Kingdom, a name given to the state’s three northeastern-most counties by former Vermont Governor George D. Aiken, who was moved by the beauty of the area. The name caught on to identify and unify an economically challenged area of the state.</p>

    <p>The main “Lodge” is not really a lodge at all – it was a farmhouse built in the 1860s by the Simpson family. Later the Goodrich family owned it and sold it to developers in 1926. These developers named the property “Highland Lodge,” and planned to build over seventy cabins and christened the main house as the ‘Lodge’. They had only built the kitchen wing of the main house, four little cabins, and sold some parcels of land before the stock market crashed in 1929 and the rest of their grand development scheme was abandoned.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, Highland Lodge was born in the 1920s and survived the Depression and WWII years as a boarding house until the Smith family bought it in 1954 as a summer resort. The property was to stay in the same family for over sixty years before it was sold to the current owners.</p>

    <p>Over the course of the 20th century, Greensboro became a coveted place to enjoy summer vacations, with many professors from Yale and Princeton bringing their whole families up to summer on Caspian Lake. Highland Lodge became a fixture of the community as both a source of lodging and as a community gathering space.</p>
