    <h1>The Highland Lodge</h1>

    <div class="content">
    <p>The wedding venue, Highland Lodge, is a historic inn that sits on Caspian Lake in a region of Vermont known as the Northeast Kingdom. It holds a special place in Amy’s family history. Amy’s parents brought her and her sister Alison here to spend a week in the summer when they were kids. The whole family was soon captivated by its peaceful beauty. We spent cool August mornings sipping hot chocolate on the sprawling front porch, while in the afternoon, we lounged by Caspian Lake, swimming or puttering around in paddle boats. Amy and Alison especially loved the summer camp program for kids, where they did craft projects and wandered through the pine forest with their counselor, Snow. </p>
<p>We returned, summer after summer, and even as we grew up, the lodge stayed just the same. </p>
<p>“There was certainty in the sameness of each summer,” Amy’s father, Bill, wrote in the opening line of his novel, <em>The Circus in the Woods</em>, which is based on his children’s experience at Highland Lodge. </p>
<p>For us, that sameness was part of the magic of Highland Lodge. More than 20 years after our first visit, it still feels just the way we remember it. </p>
<p>We hope you’ll enjoy it as much as we have.
